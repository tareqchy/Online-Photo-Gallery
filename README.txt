This is a Simple PHP Application Which can be useful for Beginners to Understand 
How all the syntax and DB operations work together to create a complete application. 
The code itself is well documented. So anyone can easily understand what is going on in each line.

Anyone can take the code as base, extend as necessary and can use in any commercial or non-commercial projects.

Any Suggestions are highly Appreciated.
